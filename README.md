# Phishing-detection-for-people-with-dyslexia

Phishing attacks threaten online security, however, individuals with dyslexia, a learning disorder characterized by difficulties reading and processing written information, face unique challenges in identifying phishing URLs due to cognitive and visual impairments. This research paper presents an innovative approach that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance phishing URL detection specifically tailored for dyslexic individuals along with specially designed web application to test their ability to understand. In this paper, we take things a step further by incorporating dyslexics, UI UX experts, and research work into the design of our study. We conducted people-based study with the help of research to evaluate the preference of a group of people with various experiences we derived from URLs, both fake and real. Additionally, we conducted a comparison research with a group of people with dyslexia and non-dyslexic people. The performance of the approach is evaluated through rigorous experiments, utilizing benchmark datasets, and user feedback from individuals. In order to evaluate the prototype and improve the usability of the user interface, the research team developed a web application.
